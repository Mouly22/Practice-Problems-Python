#The Maximum weight

print('''A sailor has a boat known as TÃ©ssares Boat, which has four corners. The boat is capable of
carrying goods of any weight as long as there is equal distribution of loads on each corner of the
boat - the center area has been occupied by the engine. The sailor needs your help to know the
maximum amount of weight he can carry in each shipment.
Write a Python program that reads the total weight of the shipment and prints the maximum load
(or weight) the boat can take from the given shipment. We can assume that the weight of each
good is exactly 1 unit, therefore, the weight of 5 units means there are 5 (loose) items in the
shipment. ''')
