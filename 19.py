print('''Write a Python program to compute and display a personâ€™s weekly salary as determined by the following conditions:
If the hours worked is less than or equal to 40, then the person receives Tk 200 per hour.
If the hours worked is greater than 40, then the person receives Tk 8000 plus Tk 300 for each hour worked over 40 hours.
The program should request the hours worked as an input from the user and display the salary as output. 
    You need to make sure that user input is valid. For example, a person cannot work for -5 hours or more than 168 hours in a week. 
So, the valid hours range is 0 to 168. For invalid hours, print outputs as given in the samples below.
    Sample Input     Sample Output
        100              26000
         30               6000
        -30          Hour cannot be negative
        170          Impossible to work more than 168 hours weekly
''')

hour = int(input("Enter weekly working hour(s): "))

if hour < 0:
    print("Hour can not be Negative.")
elif hour > 168:
    print("Impossible to work more than 168 hours weekly")
elif hour <= 40:
    salary = hour* 200
    print("Your Salary is: " + str(salary))
elif hour >= 40:
    salary = 8000 + (hour - 40)* 300
    print("Your Salary is: " + str(salary))
